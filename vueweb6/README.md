```
    Please pick a preset: `Manually select features`
    Check the features needed for your project: `Babel, Router, Vuex, Linter`
    Choose a version of Vue.js that you want to start the project with `3.x`
    Use history mode for router? (Requires proper server setup for index fallback in production) `Yes`
    Pick a linter / formatter config: `Standard`
    Pick additional lint features: `Lint on save`
    Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? `In package.json`
    Save this as a preset for future projects? `No`
